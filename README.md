# Fuel-Rate-Prediction-App
This application predicts the rate at which fuel is sold based on the following criteria: 
- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state)
- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new)
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)
We are using React with Javascript, HTML, and CSS to style and structure this application.
Connecting the React components is proving to be difficult and we are currently looking to implement the rest of the backend and database for this project.
